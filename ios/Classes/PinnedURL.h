 A PinnedURL models the concept of "pinning" an HTTPS server's DNS
 name to the public key contained in the X509 certificate it uses for
 TLS communication

 Objects of this class are immutable, and are therefore thread safe.

 Objects of this class are also container friendly because the class
 overrides the isEqual and hash methods from NSObject such that
 equality is determined by the combination of the DNS host name and
 the actual RSA public key embedded in an X509 certificate. Two
 PinnedURL objects are equal if, and only if, they contain the same
 DNS host name and RSA public key.
