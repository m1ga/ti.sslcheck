 An Objective-C wrapper around the C interface SecKeyRef from Apple's
 Security Framework.
 
 This class provides an easier to use, and more robust, interface to
 the SecKeyRef opaque type (a C interface) from Apple's Security
 Framework. The benefits this class provides are:
 
 1. Easier initialization by using an X509Certificate, which is itself
    an Objective-C wrapper around a DER encoded X509 certificate.
 
 2. Automatic memory management with ARC. There is no need to CFRetain
    and CFRelease the underlying SecKeyRef opaque type.

 3. Container friendly because this class overrides the isEqual and
    hash methods from NSObject such that equality is determined by the
    contents of SecKeyRef: two PublicKeys are equal if, and only if,
    their actual RSA public keys are identical. The X509Certificate
    used to initialize the PublicKey object does not factor into the
    implementation of isEqual or hash.

 4. It is immutable, and therefore thread safe.
 
 This is an example of creating a PublicKey object from an
 X509Certificate object (which is itself created from the DER encoded
 certificate www.foo.com.cer bundled with an app):
 
 NSURL *url = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"www.foo.com" withExtension: @"cer"];
 X509Certificate *x509Certificate = [X509Certificate X509CertificateWithURL:url];
 PublicKey *publicKey = x509Certificate.publicKey;
