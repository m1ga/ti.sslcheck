 An Objective-C wrapper around the C interface SecCertificateRef from
 Apple's Security Framework. Instances of this class provide an easier
 to use, and more robust, interface to the SecCertificateRef opaque
 type (a C interface) from Apple's Security Framework. The benefits
 this class provides are:
 
 1. Easier initialization by using a NSURL to a DER encoded X509
    certificate.
 
 2. Automatic memory management with ARC. There is no need to CFRetain
    and CFRelease the underlying SecCertificateRef opaque type.

 3. Container friendly because this class overrides the isEqual and
    hash methods from NSObject such that equality is determined by the
    contents of the instance: two instances are equal if, and only if,
    their actual X509 certificate data is identical. The value of the
    NSURL used to initialize the instances does not factor into the
    implementation of isEqual or hash.

 4. It is immutable, and therefore thread safe.
 
 5. It provides access to the certificate's public key in the form of
    a PublicKey object (which is an Objective-C wrapper around the C
    interface SecKeyRef from Apple's Security Framework).
 
 An easy way to add a DER encoded X509 certificate to your app on Mac
 OS X is to use Safari. Do this by using Safari to visit the trusted
 HTTPS web site, then click the lock icon in the title bar to view the
 sequence of certificates leading from the server's certificate to a
 trusted root. You can then drag a certificate directly to your Xcode
 project (start your drag on the large certificate icon).
 
 This is an example of creating an instances from the DER encoded
 certificate www.foo.com.cer bundled with an app:
 
 NSURL *url = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"www.foo.com" withExtension: @"cer"];
 X509Certificate *x509Certificate = [X509Certificate X509CertificateWithURL:url];
