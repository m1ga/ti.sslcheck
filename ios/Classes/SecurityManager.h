 An instance of this class authenticates a curated set of HTTPS
 servers. It does this by "pinning" an HTTPS server's DNS name to the
 public key contained in the X509 certificate it uses for TLS
 communication. The public key is embedded in an app by adding this
 X509 certificate to the app's Resources directory.

 An instance of this class will guarantee that all TLS connections
 made by NSURLConnection to the pinned DNS name are to a server that
 holds the private key corresponding to the public key embedded in the
 app, therefore authenticating the server.

 This is what prevents the "Man-in-the-Middle" attack.

 Objects of this class are also immutable, and are therefore thread
 safe.

 Instances of this class are container friendly because the class
 overrides the isEqual and hash methods from NSObject such that
 equality is determined by the equality of the set of PinnedURL used
 to construct the instance. Two instances are equal if, and only if,
 they contain the same set of PinnedURL objects.
